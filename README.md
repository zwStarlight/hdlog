# hdlog
a simple lightweight Log Library

This Library can be used in Windows & Linux with only single .h file.

I wrote this just for my personal use, and anyone is welcome to use it.

If there are bugs or good suggestions, welcome to discuss.

It only supports console, if you want to write files, maybe you can try to write additional functions by yourself jsut like functions info, warn, error etc. If you can't do this， 

you can contact me.
